# Pico Green ([P11496](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/P11496))

## Reagents

* Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA reagent (Component A; in DMSO)
* 20X TE (Component B)
* Lambda DNA standard (Component C; 100 µg/mL in TE)

## Protocol

**Prepare mixes**

1. Dilute Lambda DNA standard 1:50 in TE pH 8 (49 µL TE + 1 µL DNA standard; final concentration 2 ng/µL)
2. Prepare Picogreen mix using the following table

    | rxn | TE       | Picogreen dsDNA reagent |
    |-----|----------|-------------------------|
    |  22 |  0.66 mL |  3.3 µL                 |
    |  34 |  1.02 mL |  5.1 µL                 |
    |  58 |  1.74 mL |  8.7 µL                 |
    | 106 |  3.18 mL | 15.9 µL                 |
    | 202 |  6.06 mL | 30.3 µL                 |
    | 384 | 11.52 mL | 57.6 µL                 |

    **Note: The above number of reactions are suggested for samples + standards. If
    you want a different number of rxn then (TE = rxn X 0.03 mL) and (pico = rxn X
    0.15 µL).**

3. In one column of a 384 well plate, create a (1:2) serial dilution
    * Add 25 µL of 1:50 diluted DNA standard to the first two wells (**A and B**)
    * Add 25 µL of TE to wells (**B-P**)
    * Take 25 µL from well **B** and mix with well **C**
    * Take 25 µL from well **C** and mix with well **D**
    * Repeat until you have mixed wells up to **O**
    * Discard 25 µL from well **O**
    * Leave **P** with just 25 µL of TE
4. Add 24 µL of TE to enough wells for all of your samples, then add 1 µL of DNA sample to each of these wells
6. Add 25 µL of diluted Picogreen dsDNA reagent (see **step 2**) to all wells containing standards and samples
7. Quantify and calculate standard curve using following concentrations:
    
    | Row   | Std #   | Concentration    |
    | ----- | ------- | ---------------  |
    | A     | 1       | 50 ng/µL         |
    | B     | 2       | 25 ng/µL         |
    | C     | 3       | 12.5 ng/µL       |
    | D     | 4       | 6.25 ng/µL       |
    | E     | 5       | 3.125 ng/µL      |
    | F     | 6       | 1.563 ng/µL      |
    | G     | 7       | 0.781 ng/µL      |
    | H     | 8       | 0.39 ng/µL       |
    | I     | 9       | 0.195 ng/µL      |
    | J     | 10      | 0.098 ng/µL      |
    | K     | 11      | 0.049 ng/µL      |
    | L     | 12      | 0.024 ng/µL      |
    | M     | 13      | 0.012 ng/µL      |
    | N     | 14      | 0.006 ng/µL      |
    | O     | 15      | 0.003 ng/µL      |
    | P     | 16      | 0 ng/µL          |
        
9. Use the formula for the standard curve to estimate sample concentrations<sup>[2](#conc)</sup>
