# Pico Green ([P11496](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/P11496))

## Reagents

* Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA reagent (Component A; in DMSO)
* 20X TE (Component B)
* Lambda DNA standard (Component C; 100 µg/ml in TE)

## Protocol

**Prepare mixes**
1. Dilute Lambda DNA standard 1:50 in TE pH 8 (49 µl TE + 1 µl DNA standard; final concentration 2 ng/µl)
2. Prepare Picogreen mix using the following table

| rxn | TE       | Picogreen dsDNA reagent |
|-----|----------|-------------------------|
|  22 |  0.66 ml |  3.3 µl                 |
|  34 |  1.02 ml |  5.1 µl                 |
|  58 |  1.74 ml |  8.7 µl                 |
| 106 |  3.18 ml | 15.9 µl                 |
| 202 |  6.06 ml | 30.3 µl                 |
| 384 | 11.52 ml | 57.6 µl                 |

**Note: The above number of reactions are suggested for samples + standards. If
you want a different number of rxn then (TE = rxn X 0.03 ml) and (pico = rxn X
0.15 µl).**

3. In one column of a 384 well plate, create a (1:2) serial dilution
    * Add 25 µl of 1:50 diluted DNA standard to the first two wells (**A and B**)
    * Add 25 µl of TE to wells (**B-H**)
    * Take 25 µl from well **B** and mix with well **C**
    * Take 25 µl from well **C** and mix with well **D**
    * Repeat until you have mixed wells up to **H**
    * Discard 25 µl from well **H**
4. Add 24 µl of TE to enough wells for all of your samples, then add 1 µl of DNA sample to each of these wells
6. Add 25 µl of diluted Picogreen dsDNA reagent (see **step 2**) to all wells containing standards and samples
7. Quantify using plate reader
8. Calculate standard curve using following concentrations:

| Row | Std # | Concentration  |
|-----|-------|---------------:|
| A   | 1     | 50 ng/µl       |
| B   | 2     | 25 ng/µl       |
| C   | 3     | 12.5 ng/µl     |
| D   | 4     | 6.25 ng/µl     |
| E   | 5     | 3.125 ng/µl    |
| F   | 6     | 1.563 ng/µl    |
| G   | 7     | 0.781 ng/µl    |
| H   | 8     | 0.39 ng/µl     |

9. Use the formula for the standard curve to estimate sample concentrations
