This is a collection of protocols that I have added to github for basic version
control. To print a protocol simply go the protocol with you webbrowser and in
the URL change `github` to `gitprint`. For example:

**Change:**

[](https://github.com/jfear/protocols/blob/master/dna/dna_extraction_chloroform_phenol.md)

**to:**

[](https://gitprint.com/jfear/protocols/blob/master/dna/dna_extraction_chloroform_phenol.md)
