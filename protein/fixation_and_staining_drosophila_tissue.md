## Reagents
* PBS (pH 7.4 [gibco 10010-023](http://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/10010023))
* PFA (4%)
* PBT (1% Triton x-100 in PBS)
* PBTB (0.3% Triton x-100 and 1% BSA in PBS)

## Protocol
### Fixation and staining
1. Dissect tissues and store in PBS.
2. Transfer tissues to a 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube with 30 µl of PBS.
3. Aspirate<sup>[1](#aspirate)</sup> and add 1 ml of ice cold PFA (4%).
    * Agitate gently on a rocker for 20-25 min
4. Remove PFA and wash agitating gently with 1 ml of PBT (4 times) for:
    * 5 min
    * 20 min
    * 20 min
    * 20 min
5. Remove washing buffer and add 1 ml of blocking buffer (PBTB) for at least 1.5 hr (agitating gently).<sup>[2](#block)</sup>
6. Remove blocking buffer and add 100 µl of primary antibody. Incubate overnight in a cold room agitating gently.
7. Remove antibody<sup>[3](antibody)</sup> and wash 3 times (30 min ea.) with PBTB.
8. Add secondary antibody (500 µl) and incubate in dark for 2 hr with gentle agitation.
9. Wash 3 times for 30 minutes each with 0.3% PBT with gentle agitation.

### Mounting


## Notes
1. <a name="aspirate"></a> When aspirating be careful not to remove any tissue.
2. <a name="block"></a> The longer you can block the better. If doing for an extended period then perform at 4ºC.
3. <a name="antibody"></a> The primary antibody can be used multiple times, so save the liquid you aspirate off.
